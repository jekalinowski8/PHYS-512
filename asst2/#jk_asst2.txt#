Question 1:

a)Code in contained in question1(). question1(x) will return log2(x) as estimated by the Chebyshev fit. question1(plot=True) will show the cheb and poly fits and their residuals. question1(showErr=True) shows the maximum and rms errors of both fit types. 

A sixth order Chebyshev fit (7 terms) are needed for guaranteed accuracy better than 10^-6.

Here are the error comparisons in a chebfit vs polyfit:
Max Cheb Err: 7.88869960355e-07
Max Poly Err: 4.95546897916e-06
RMS Cheb Err: 8.8258445572e-08
RMS Poly Err: 5.85823788789e-07
